## Notes

Throughout the following, we assume you're creating a dashboard server named `dashboard.example.com`. Change this to whatever you like. For convenience, we name other things consistently:

`/opt/docker/dashboard.example.com` is the directory (on the host system) containing the docker files.

`/var/opt/docker/dashboard.example.com` is the directory (on the host system) containing persistent data.

We assume that you're familiar with Node-RED.

## Cloud-Provider Setup

First you have to choose a cloud provider and install Docker and Docker-Compose. That's very much provider dependent.

### On Digital Ocean

_Last Update: 2019-04-30_

#### Create droplet

1. Log in at [Digital Ocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/)

2. Create a new project (if needed) to hold your new droplet.

3. Discover > Marketplace, search for `Docker`

4. You shoud come to this page: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/marketplace/5ba19751fc53b8179c7a0071?i=ec3581

5. Press "Create"

6. Select the standard 8G GB Starter that is selected.

7. Choose a datacenter; I chose New York.

8. Additional options: none.

9. Add your SSH keys.

10. Choose a host name, e.g. `passivehouse-ecovillage`.

11. Select your project.

12. Press "Create"

#### Configure droplet

1. Note the IP address from above.

2. `ssh root@{ipaddress}`

3. Remove the motd.

4. Add user:

   ```sh
   adduser username
   adduser username admin
   adduser username docker
   adduser username plugdev
   adduser username staff
   ```

5. Disable root login via SSH or via password

6. Optional: enable `username` to sudo without password.

   ```sh
   sudo VISUAL=vi visudo
   ```

   Add the following line at the bottom:

   ```sudoers
   username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

7. Test that you can become `username`:

   ```console
   # sudo -i username
   username@host-name:~$
   ```

8. Drop back to root, and then copy the authorized_keys file to `~username`:

   ```sh
   mkdir -m 700 ~username/.ssh
   cp -p .ssh/authorized_keys ~username/.ssh
   chown -R username.username ~username/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

9. See if you can ssh in.

10. Optional: set up byobu by default:

   ```sh
   byobu
   byobu-enable
   ```

11. Set the host name.

    ```sh
    vi /etc/hosts
    ```

    Change the line `127.0.1.1 name name` to `127.0.0.1 myhost.myfq.dn myhost`.

12. If needed, use `hostnamectl` to set the static hostname to match `myhost`.

13. set up Git:

   ```sh
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install git
   ```

14. We'll put the docker files at `/opt/docker/docker-ttn-dashboard`, setting up as follows:

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir /opt/docker
   cd /opt/docker
   sudo chgrp admin .
   sudo chmod g+w .
   ```

## After server is set up

The following instructions are essentially independent of the cloud provider and the underlying distribution. But we've only tested on Ubuntu and (in 2017) on CentOS.

1. Clone this repo.

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:mcci-catena/docker-ttn-dashboard.git /opt/docker/dashboard.example.com
   ```

2. move to that repo

   ```sh
   cd /opt/docker/dashboard.example.com
   ```

3. Get a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your server, for which you control DNS. Point it to your server. Make sure it works, using "`dig FQDN`" -- you should get back an `A` record pointing to your server's IP address.

### Create and edit the `.env` file

1. Create a `.env` file. To get a template:

   ```sh
   sed -ne '/^#+++/,/^#---/p' docker-compose.yml | sed -e '/^#[^ \t]/d' -e '/^# TTN/s/$/=/' > .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file as follows:

   1. `TTN_DASHBOARD_APACHE_FQDN=myhost.example.com`
   This sets the name of your resulting server. It tells Apache what it's serving out.  It must be a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) that resolves to the IP address of the container host.

   2. `TTN_DASHBOARD_CERTBOT_FQDN=myhost.example.com`
   This should be the same as `TTN_DASHBOARD_APACHE_FQDN`.

   3. `TTN_DASHBOARD_CERTBOT_EMAIL=someone@example.com`
   This sets the contact email for Let's Encyrypt. The script automatically accepts the Let's Encrypt terms of service, and this indicates who is doing the accepting.

   4. `TTN_DASHBOARD_DATA=/full/path/to/directory/`
   The trailing slash is required!
   This will put all the data file for this instance as subdirectories of the specified path. If you leave this underfined, `docker-compose` will print error messages and quit.

   5. `TTN_DASHBOARD_GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=SomethingVerySecretIndeed`
   This sets the *initial* password for the Grafana `admin` login. You should change this via the Grafana UI after booting the server.

   6. `TTN_DASHBOARD_GRAFANA_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS`
   This sets the Grafana originating mail address.

   7. `TTN_DASHBOARD_GRAFANA_INSTALL_PLUGINS`
   This sets a list of Grafana plugins to install.

   8. `TTN_DASHBOARD_INFLUXDB_INITIAL_DATABASE_NAME=demo`
   Change "demo" to the desired name of the initial database that will be created in InfluxDB.

   9. `TTN_DASHBOARD_MAIL_HOST_NAME=myhost.example.com`
   This sets the name of your mail server. Used by Postfix.

   10. `TTN_DASHBOARD_MAIL_DOMAIN=example.com`
   This sets the domain name of your mail server. Used by Postfix.

   11. `TTN_DASHBOARD_TIMEZONE=Europe/Paris`
   If not defined, the default timezone will be GMT.

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```sh
### env file for configuring dashboard.example.com

#       The fully-qualified domain name to be served by Apache.

```

### Set up the Node-RED and InfluxDB API logins

1. Prepare everything:

    ```sh
    docker-compose pull
    ````

   If there are any errors, fix them before

2. Use `docker-compose run apache /bin/bash` to launch a shell in the Apache context.

   * If this fails with the message, `ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?`, then probably your user ID is not in the `docker` group. To fix this, `sudo adduser MYUSER docker`, where "MYUSER" is your login ID. Then (**very important**) log out and log back in.

3. Add Apache's `/etc/apache2/authdata` as user www-data

   ```sh
   chown www-data /etc/apache2/authdata
   ```

4. Add Apache's `/etc/apache2/authdata/.htpasswd`.

   ```sh
   touch /etc/apache2/authdata/.htpasswd
   chown www-data /etc/apache2/authdata/.htpasswd
   ```

5. Add user logins for node-red and influxdb queries. Make `USERS` be a list of login IDs.

   ```sh
   export USERS="tmm amy josh"
   for USER in $USERS; do echo "Set password for "$USER; htpasswd /etc/apache2/authdata/.htpasswd $USER; done
   ```

6. Add Apache's `/etc/apache2/authdata/.htgroup`.

   ```sh
   # this assumes USERS is still set from previous step.
   touch /etc/apache2/authdata/.htgroup
   chown www-data /etc/apache2/authdata/.htgroup
   echo "node-red: ${USERS}" >>/etc/apache2/authdata/.htgroup
   echo "query: ${USERS}" >>/etc/apache2/authdata/.htgroup
   ```

7. Exit Apache's container with Ctrl-D.

## Start the server

1. We recommend you first start things up in "interactive mode".

    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

   This will show you the log files. It will also be pretty clear if there are any issues.

   One common error (for me, anyway) is entering an illegal initial InfluxDB database name. InfluxDB will spew a number of errors, but eventually it will start up anyway. But then you'll need to create a database manually.

### Restart servers in the background

Once the servers are coming up interactively, use ^C to shut them down, then restart in daemon mode.

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Initial testing

- Open Grafana on **https://dashboard.example.com**, and log in as admin.

- Change the admin password.

#### Set up first data source

Use the Grafana UI -- either click on "add first data source" or use "Configure>Add Data Source", and add an InfluxDB data source.

- Set the URL (under Http Settings) to `http://influxdb:8086`.

- Select the database.  If InfluxDB properly initialized a database, you should also be able to connect to it as a Grafana datasource. If not, you'll first need to [create an InfluxDB database](#creating-an-influxdb-database).

* Leave user and password blank.

* Click "Save & Test".

### Test Node-RED

Open Node-RED on **https://dashboard.example.com/node-red/**, and build a flow that stores data in InfluxDB. **Be sure to add the trailing slash! Otherwise you'll get a 404 from Grafana. We'll fix this soon.**

### Creating an InfluxDB database

To create a database, log in to the host machine, and cd to `/opt/docker/dashboard.example.com`. Use the following commands:

```console
$ docker-compose exec influxdb /bin/bash
# influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.7.6
InfluxDB shell version: 1.7.6
Enter an InfluxQL query
> show databases
name: databases
name
----
_internal
> create database "my-new-database"
> show databases
name: databases
name
----
_internal
my-new-database
> ^D
# ^D
$
```
